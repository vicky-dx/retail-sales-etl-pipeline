# 🛒 Retail Sales ETL Pipeline

This is a sanitized version of a project I originally built during a freelance engagement (Aug 2021 – Mar 2022) for a retail e-commerce client.

It covers:
- Automated ingestion of daily sales data
- Cleaning & transformation using AWS Glue (Python)
- Loading into Amazon Redshift with star schema modeling
- Business dashboards using Tableau

> 📝 Note: This is a **reconstructed** version of a freelance project I worked on.  
> All datasets and logic have been anonymized/simulated for demonstration.
